                        <h3>
                            In JavaScript (JS), events are actions or occurrences that happen in the user interface or the browser. These events can be triggered by various actions, such as a user clicking a button, pressing a key, or the browser finishing loading a web page.
                        </h3>

                            Event Listeners
                        </h2>
                        <h3>
                            An event listener is required if you want your program to recognise that you called an event to execute a function. For every function that you put, you will have to add an event listener to an event in JS (for example, the clicking of a button). In short, Event listeners "listen" for specific events and execute a function when the event occurs.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Types of Events in JS</h2>

                            <h3>
                                The onclick listener in JavaScript is an event handler that is used to execute a particular piece of code when an element, such as a button or a link, is clicked by the user. It is commonly used to create interactivity and trigger actions in response to user input.
                            </h3>
                            <h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mousedown()</h2>
                            <h3>
                                Occurs when the mouse button is pressed down. This is different from onclick() because it detects if a mouse button is being held down instead of clicked.
                            </h3>
                            <h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouseover()</h2>
                            <h3>
                                Occurs when the mouse pointer enters an element.

                                Occurs when a key is pressed and held down.

                            <h3>
                                Occurs when a key is pressed down and released.
                            </h3>
                            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load()</h2>
                            <h3>
                                Occurs when the page/document has finished loading. This is primarily for loading screens, which we will cover in one of our extra lessons (Lesson 11 about animations)
                            </h3>
                        
                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Parameters</h2>
                        <h3>
                            In JavaScript, parameters are the values passed to a function when it is called. A function can have zero or more parameters, which are defined in the function's declaration. Note that parameters in JavaScript are optional, meaning that you can define a function with no parameters with empty brackets (for example, onclick())    
                        </h3>
                        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are parameters used for?</h2>
                        <h3>
                            In JavaScript, parameters are used in function definitions to specify the variables that a function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters act as placeholders for values that will be passed into the function.

                            <br>Function parameters allow you to pass values to a function so that you can use and manipulate those values within the function's code. They define the inputs that a function expects, and you can specify multiple parameters separated by commas.
                        </h3>

                        <h3>
                            By using parameters, you can create functions that can work with different data or conditions. This makes your code more modular, reusable, and adaptable to different scenarios.
                        </h3>
                        <h3> Here is an example: Suppose you are making a quiz and want to make a hint button (with an id called Hintbutton) to display a hint (with id Hintparagraph), so you type:
                            <br> &nbsp;
                            <br> function buttonclick() {
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; document.querySelectorAll(#Hintbutton).length; i++) {
                            
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (paragraph.style.display === 'none') {
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.style.display = 'block';
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.style.visibility = "visible";

                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.style.display = 'none';
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.style.visibility = "hidden";
                            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
                    <br>     } 
                        </h3>
                        <h3><br> 
                            which produces the following results:
                        </h3>

                        <br>
                        <h3> However, you find that if you click any button in the iframe, all paragraphs with the id paragraph will show.</h3>
                        <h3> so instead, using parameters, you can configurate the code accordingly:</h3>

                                JavaScript, also abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, object-oriented scripting language used to program functionality to an HTML page.
                                The language is quintessential for web developers to process user inputs and manipulate HTML and CSS content, making a website much more than a static slideshow.
                                Javascript can interact with HTML in many ways, but most often you will link functions to buttons and other user actions,
                                manipulating elements by finding their assigned IDs and making respective modifications.
                                JavaScript is often paired with 3rd-party libraries such as JQuery. But for simplicity, this course will stick with fundamental JS.
