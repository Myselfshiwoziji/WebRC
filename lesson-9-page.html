                        <h3>
                            Classes in Javascript are an easy way to define and create objects with a blueprint for their properties and methods. Much like Json, they can be used to easily store information about an object.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Method</h2>
                        <h3>
                            Methods in Javascript are functions that are associated with a class or an object, which represents behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. When a method is called, it can access and manipulate the data within the object it belongs to, and it can also interact with other objects or perform other operations.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Constructor</h2>
                        <h3>
                            A constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the newly created object and to set initial values for its properties and perform any other setup that may be required.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Making classes</h2>
                        <h3>
                            To make a class, you use the syntax:
                            <code>class example {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(property1, property2) {
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.property1 = some property 1;
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.property2 = some property 2;
                                <br>&emsp;}

                                <br><br>&emsp;method1 {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;method logic here
                                <br>&emsp;}

                                <br><br>&emsp;method2 {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;method logic here
                                <br>&emsp;}
                                <br>}
                            </code>
                            <br><br>Keep in mind that you can have as many properties and methods as you want. To assign something to a class, use the syntax: 
                            <br><code>let name_of_object = new example(property1, property2)</code><br> but replace name of object with the name of what you want to call it, example to your class name, and the properties.
                            <br><br> To call a method, use the syntax:
                            <br><code>name_of_object.method1()</code><br> and replace the placeholders accordingly.

                        </h3>
                        
                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Example of classes</h2>
                        <h3>Say, you want to have a class 'Circle' that you can call, and you want to be able to get its area. You can make a class like this:<code>
                            <br>class Circle {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(radius) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.radius = radius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              
                                <br><br>&emsp;getArea() {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              
                                <br><br>&emsp;setRadius(newRadius) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.radius = newRadius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              <br>}</code>
                              <br> In this example, you can see that the properties are radius, and the methods are getArea() and setRadius(newRadius).
                        </h3>
                        <h3><br>
                            Or, you want to have a counter that you can add or delete values from: <code>
                                <br>class Counter {
                                    <br>&emsp;constructor() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count = 0;
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  
                                    <br><br>&emsp;increment() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count++;
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  
                                    <br><br>&emsp;decrement() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count--;
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  <br>}
                            </code>
                            <br><br>As you can see, calling the increment() function in the class Counter would raise it by 1, while calling decrement() would decrease the counter by 1.

                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Subclasses</h2>
                        <h3>
                            Sub-classes, also known as derived classes or child classes, are classes that inherit properties and methods from another class, known as the superclass, base class, or parent class. When a class inherits from another class, it automatically gains access to all the public and protected members (properties and methods) of the parent class.
                            The sub-class can also add its own methods and properties, as well as override or extend the behavior of the inherited methods.

                            For example, consider this class:<code>
                            class Animal {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(name) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.name = name;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                                
                                <br>&emsp;speak() {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              <br>}</code>

                              <br>As seen from the example, the class animal makes a noise whenever it speaks. However, what if we specifically want a dog (which belongs under the class animal) to bark instead? 
                              To do that, we can assign a sub-class:
                              <code>
                                <br>class Dog extends Animal {
                                    <br>&emsp;speak() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;console.log(this.name + ' barks.');
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  <br>}
                              </code>
                              
                              <br>As seen from above, you can use <code>extend</code> to make a subclass (in this case dog of animal), which has all the properties of the class <code>animal</code> but also special methods.

                            Much like starting your first HTML file, you can right click on the left hand side menu to create a new file.
                            This file should not contain spaces and must end with .css to declare that it is a CSS file.
                            Once done, return to the HTML document that you want to link the CSS document to and go inside the head element of the file.
                            Once there, type: <br/> <code>&lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "The CSS file's name"&gt;</code> <br/> Once you are done with that, you should now be able to code your CSS file such so that it should influence the visuals of the HTML page.

To use it, simply just state what font you would like to use (eg: Arial, Times New Roman, etc). However, there are many fonts that are unsupported in CSS, so if you want to import your own fonts that you would like to use, please check out <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15mF_XAOB8&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwP0AxnbBiDBCi53LK9uCMZ&index=13&t=0s">this tutorial</a>.

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Border:</h2><h3>This declaration is used to add borders to your selected elements. When using this declaration, you have to first declare the width of the border (for now use pixels), then declare the style of the border (which can be: solid, dotted, double, dashed, inset, outset, ridge, groove, and hidden), and finally declare a color for the border (once again, you have to use the RGB system to define the color).
                                An example of how the syntax would look like would be:<br /> <code>border: 5px, solid, rgb(0,0,0);</code>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Border radius:</h2><h3> This is a very simple declaration and links back to the previous declaration on borders. The border radius declaration simply declares how round the edges of the border will become. To use this, you have to input how round you want to make the borders using pixels (or other supported units of measurement in Visual Studio Code). <br/> Note: if you want to make a completley circular border, you can set the border radius to the height of the element.
                                When you use this delcaration, use the syntax:<br /> <code>border-radius: 2px;</code>

It allows you to create space inside an element, pushing the content away from the edges, or shrink or increase the inside of the element to a degree. To customise the padding of an element using CSS, you can type:<br>
                                <code>padding: INSERT VALUE HERE;</code> <br><br> If you want to be much more specific on exactly which area of the padding that you want to customise you can type a dash and a direction (top, left, right, and bottom) after the padding to specify 
                                which padding you want to change. For example: <br> <code>padding-left: 8px;</code>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Border</h2>
                            <h3>In HTML, a border refers to the boundary or outline that surrounds an element. It is a visual property that helps differentiate and define the edges of an element on a web page.

                                Borders can be applied to various HTML elements such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, and more. They can be customized in terms of color, style, and width.

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Margins</h2>
                            <h3>Much like in English, the margin is basically the space between where the element originally was and where it currently is. This might sound confusing at first, but when you first place a element
                                on a page, there is going to be a default placement for the element on the page. If you use a declaration such as <code>margin-left: 20px;</code>, then the element will shift from its original position to 20px to the 
                                right of its original position.
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                To customise the margin of the element, you can use the declaration: <br> <code>margin: top Spacing right Spacing bottom Spacing left Spacing;</code> <br> Alternativly, much like the padding 
                                declaration, you can add a dash and then type in the direction of the margin (top, bottom, left, right) to specify exactly where you want to place a margin spacing on your element.
