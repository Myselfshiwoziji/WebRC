                        <h3> Incase you forgot, embed in HTML, you can embed a video with the following syntax:
                            <br> &lt; video controls &gt; &lt; source src = "Path to your video" &gt; &lt; video &gt;
                            <br> Or an image with the following syntax:
                            <br> &lt; img src = "Link to your image" &gt;
                            <br> Similar methods and logic are used for IFrames.

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle"> What are IFrames?</h2>
                            <h3> IFrames, or otherwise known as Incline Frames, are HTML elements that allow you to embed another HTML document within the current page, essentially creating a rectangular window that displays the content of another document. When you use an iframe, you specify the source URL of the document you want to display within it, then 
                                the content of the document specified by the source URL will be loaded and rendered inside the IFrame. In short, IFrames allows you to incorporate external content, such as videos, maps, and social media feeds, into your webpage, as well as control their styles like you would do in CSS.
                            </h3>
                            
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">How do i use an IFrame?</h2>
                            <h3> The syntax for IFrames are similar to that of images and videos, with it being:
                                <br> &lt; iframe src = "link to your website " width = " " height = " "&gt; &lt;/iframe &gt;

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle"> Practice page</h2>
                            <h3> Remember how at the end of every page there was a practice document? Well, it is created using iframes with the following syntax:
                                <br> &lt; iframe src = "lesson-lesson_no-practice.html" width = "600px" height = "600px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Advertisements</h2>
                            <h3>If you've ever been to a website hosted by a company before, it is likely to have ads everywhere. This is done not by implementing every ad (which would take forever), but by setting iframes where the ads can appear, then displays more information as you click on it. Heres an example:
                            </h3>
                            <a> <iframe src = "lesson-6-ad-example.html" width = "340px" height = "340px" style = "align-items: center;" >
                            </iframe></a>
                            <h3>Heres the syntax used:
                            <br>&lt;a&gt; &lt;iframe src = "lesson-7-ad-example.html" width = "340px" height = "340px" style = "align-items: center;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                            <br> where lesson-7-ad-example is just an image with an embedded url. 
                            <br> Do note that when you learn JS later, you will learn the onclick() command, which is better for changing images on click. 
                            </h3>



                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Video embedding</h2>
                            <h3>See how our lecture videos pop out a window instead of redirecting you to a youtube link? That is also done using iframes. The syntax used here is:
                                <br> &lt;iframe&gt;&lt;href = "link to video"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
                                <br> Heres an example:
                                <br>
                                <iframe src = "lesson-6-page-practice-example.html" width = "340px" height = "340px" style = "align-self: center;"></iframe>
