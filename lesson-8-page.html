                        <h3>
                            Classes in Javascript are an easy way to define and create objects with a blueprint for their properties and methods. Much like Json, they can be used to easily store information about an object.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Method</h2>
                        <h3>
                            Methods in Javascript are functions that are associated with a class or an object, which represents behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. When a method is called, it can access and manipulate the data within the object it belongs to, and it can also interact with other objects or perform other operations.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Constructor</h2>
                        <h3>
                            A constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the newly created object and to set initial values for its properties and perform any other setup that may be required.
                             Think of it like attributes that a class has, that is loaded before any of the methods take place.
                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Making classes</h2>
                        <h3>
                            To make a class, you use the syntax:
                            <code>class example {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(property1, property2) {
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.property1 = some property 1;
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.property2 = some property 2;
                                <br>&emsp;}

                                <br><br>&emsp;method1 {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;method logic here
                                <br>&emsp;}

                                <br><br>&emsp;method2 {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;method logic here
                                <br>&emsp;}
                                <br>}
                            </code>
                            <br><br>Keep in mind that you can have as many properties and methods as you want. To assign something to a class, use the syntax: 
                            <br><code>let name_of_object = new example(property1, property2)</code><br> but replace name of object with the name of what you want to call it, example to your class name, and the properties.
                            <br><br> To call a method, use the syntax:
                            <br><code>name_of_object.method1()</code><br> and replace the placeholders accordingly.

                        </h3>
                        
                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Example of classes</h2>
                        <h3>Say, you want to have a class 'Circle' that you can call, and you want to be able to get its area. You can make a class like this:<code>
                            <br>class Circle {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(radius) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.radius = radius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              
                                <br><br>&emsp;getArea() {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              
                                <br><br>&emsp;setRadius(newRadius) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.radius = newRadius;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              <br>}</code>
                              <br> In this example, you can see that the properties are radius, and the methods are getArea() and setRadius(newRadius).
                        </h3>
                        <h3><br>
                            Or, you want to have a counter that you can add or delete values from: <code>
                                <br>class Counter {
                                    <br>&emsp;constructor() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count = 0;
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  
                                    <br><br>&emsp;increment() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count++;
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  
                                    <br><br>&emsp;decrement() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.count--;
                                    <br>&emsp;}

                            </code>
                            <br><br>As you can see, calling the increment() function in the class Counter would raise it by 1, while calling decrement() would decrease the counter by 1.

                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Subclasses</h2>
                        <h3>
                            Sub-classes, also known as derived classes or child classes, are classes that inherit properties and methods from another class, known as the superclass, base class, or parent class. When a class inherits from another class, it automatically gains access to all the public and protected members (properties and methods) of the parent class.
                            The sub-class can also add its own methods and properties, as well as override or extend the behavior of the inherited methods.

                            For example, consider this class:<code>
                            class Animal {
                                <br>&emsp;constructor(name) {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;this.name = name;
                                <br>&emsp;}
                                
                                <br>&emsp;speak() {
                                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
                                <br>&emsp;}
                              <br>}</code>

                              <br>As seen from the example, the class animal makes a noise whenever it speaks. However, what if we specifically want a dog (which belongs under the class animal) to bark instead? 
                              To do that, we can assign a sub-class:
                              <code>
                                <br>class Dog extends Animal {
                                    <br>&emsp;speak() {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;console.log(this.name + ' barks.');
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                  <br>}
                              </code>
                              
                              <br>As seen from above, you can use <code>extend</code> to make a subclass (in this case dog of animal), which has all the properties of the class <code>animal</code> but also special methods.

                              The syntax to make a subclass is:
                              <code>
                                <br> class subclass_name extends parent_class_name {
                                    <br>&emsp;method {
                                        <br>&emsp;&emsp; method logic here
                                    <br>&emsp;}
                                <br>}
                              </code>

                        </h3>

                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">Superclass</h2>
                        <h3>
                            As the name suggests, superclass is the opposite of subclass; used specifically in subclass to refer to its parent class, usually in the method or constructor of a subclass. It is particularly useful in cases where you are extending a class using the "extends" keyword and need to access and initialize the parent class's properties.
                            To reference a superclass, the syntax is:
                            <br><code>
                                method {
                                    <br>&emsp; method logic
                                <br>&emsp; super()
                                    <br>&emsp; method logic
                                <br>}
                            </code>

                        <h3>
                            To make sprites, I recommend you use a software that makes a sprite sheet for you, given that you draw the animations. This reduces the amount of load on the local host when loading an animation, which can improve its optimisation.
                            However, if you are not familiar with spritesheets or do not have a software that can do such thing, putting pngs of animations are also fine. If you don't have a sprite making software, there is this <a href = "https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite">Online application</a> that can make pixel art, although you can make other sprites.
                        </h3>
                        <h2 class = "contentTitle">create()</h2>
                        <h3>
                        Create(), not to be confused with object.create(), a default command in Javascript, in phaser is defined as a special built-in constructor to generate game content, without the need of external files. Within the <code>create()</code> method, you can include code to create sprites, set up physics, add text or buttons, and perform various other initializations necessary for setting up the game environment. For example:
                        <br><code>create() {
                            <br>&emsp;var screen = this.add.image(100, 100, 'screen'); //we will talk about adding sprites later on
                            <br>&emsp;this.add.text(50, 50, 'Welcome to the game', { font: '24px Arial', fill: '#ffffff' });
                            <br>&emsp;Other methods or functions...
                        <br>}</code>
                        <br>Note that the syntax for adding sprites is <code>this.add.sprite(x coordinate, y coordinate, sprite1, sprite2, ...)</code>, where x and y coordinates are measured from the top left of the screen (0,0) in pixels.
                        <br>Thus, the general syntax for create would be:<code>
                        <br>create() {
                            <br>&emsp;var object = this.add.sprite(x-coordinate,y-coordinate, sprite1, sprite2, ...)
                            <br>&emsp;Methods or functions of sprite
                        <br>}</code>
                        <br>Be sure to switch object, coordinates, and sprites accordingly.

                        <h3> This command is quite self-explanatory... it creates the player. You use the syntax:

                            The preload() function is a function you put inside of a class where it preloads everything in the class as you call it (similar to an instructor). However, as implied, they are already loaded before you call the class, meaning they are global variables. For the purpose of these lessons, we encourge you to put the following objects in preload: Background images, Player & Enemy spritesheets, as well as CursorKeys and keyboard keys (Which will be discussed in the next lesson)

                            <h3> The update() command is a command you put in your class which tells the game what to look out for when it updates in-game (depending on your framerate, it may go from 10-60 per second). Some examples which we will be using in the next lesson are: Movement keys (W,A,S,D), Left & Right mouse button click, Healthbar, and Stamina. Ofcourse, this selection is chosen because it will be relevant to our exercise, but note that anything that needs updating will be put here. Heres an example:
                                <code><br>var keys = this.input.keyboard.addKeys("W,A,S,D")</code> // adds W, A, S, D keyboard keys to be detected by the game, if you want to use arrow keys, use the syntax: this.cursor = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys() and <b>put it in create() instead of update()</b>. Then, simply replace 'keys.A.isDown' with 'this.cursors.left.isDown' and do it for the other movement directions.
                                    <code><br>if (keys.A.isDown)
                                    <br>{
                                        <br>&emsp;this.player.setVelocityX(-160)

                                        <br>&emsp;this.player.setVelocityX(160)

                                    <br>}
                                    <br>else if (keys.S.isDown)
                                    <br>{
                                        <br>&emsp;this.player.setVelocityY(160)
                            
                                    <br>}
                                    <br>else this.player.setVelocityY(0)</code>

                                <h3>
                                    As seen from above, Phaser itself does not recognise cursor and keyboard keys by default, so you'll have to import them. To import cursor keys (arrow, space) you use the syntax <code>this.cursors = createCursorKeys()</code> in preload() or create(), while if you want to import specific keys on your keyboard, use the syntax <code>var keys = this.input.keyboard.addKeys('add your key here', 'key 2', ...) in update() or create().</code>

                            <h3>
                                To put everything together, first you need to make some sprites. It doesnt have to be complicated, but i recommend making 3 types of sprites for our lessons (they will be used in the next lesson), 1 walking animation, 1 action animation (swinging of a sword, shooting of gun, or otherwise), and 1 dying animation, as well as atleast 1 background. (you can see where this is leading up to, we will be making a vampire-slayer or soul-knight type of survival game next lesson.)
                                <br>For example:

                            <h3>
                                This should be quite explanatory, but to put sprites, I recommend you to have a folder for your sprites, for easier referencing and developing. 
                                You can simply import your spritesheets in the folder, like this:<br>
                                <img src ="Imgs_and_stuff/rat.jpg" style = "width:400px; height:400px">
                                <h3>If you want to, you can also have a seperate folder for backgrounds, although it is not necessary.</h3>
                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "HeaderPoint">Creating your classes</h2>
                            <h3>
                                In phaser, the main class 'Phaser.scene' will be the class for scenes. To add a scene, you have to input a subclass as a child to the parent class Phaser.scene. And to make a loading screen, you have to use <code>export default class class_here extends Phaser.scene{}</code> instead. It is recommended that you save this scene as a loading or menu screen.
                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Background and loading screens</h2>
                            <h3>
                                In this lesson, we are only going to be focusing on creating classes for background and loading screens. your loading screen should use the syntax <code>export default class class_here extends Phaser.scene{}</code> as mentioned above, while your other scenes can be defined as <code>class class_name extends Phaser.scene {}</code>.
