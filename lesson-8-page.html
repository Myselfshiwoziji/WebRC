                            Time to bring your website to life!
                            JavaScript, also abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, object-oriented scripting language used to program functionality to an HTML page.
                            The language is quintessential for web developers to process user inputs and manipulate HTML and CSS content, making a website much more than a static slideshow.
                            Javascript can interact with HTML in many ways, but most often you will link functions to buttons and other user actions,
                            manipulating elements by finding their assigned IDs and making respective modifications.
                            JavaScript is often paired with 3rd-party libraries such as JQuery. But for simplicity, this course will stick with fundamental JS.

                        <h3>
                            Much like CSS, right click on the left hand side menu of Visual Studio Code to create a new file.
                            Give the file a name ending in .js to declare it for JavaScript.
                            Once created, return to your HTML document.
                            Unlike with CSS files, which are placed in the header, it is best practice to link your JavaScript file just before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> closing tab of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.
                            This is so all HTML elements are loaded before the script runs.
                            Once there, type:
                            <br/>
                            <code> &lt;script src = "javascript_file_name.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
                            <br/>
                            Once written, you should now be able to code your JavaScript file such that it can monitor and manipulate the HTML page.
