                        <h3>
                            CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the visual appearance of a document written in a markup language like HTML. 
                            It defines how elements within a web page should be displayed, giving web developers control over things like layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a website.
                            CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements using selectors, which target specific elements or groups of elements, and then applying various properties and values to those elements to define their visual characteristics. 
                            By separating the presentation layer (CSS) from the content layer (HTML), CSS allows for consistent styling across multiple web pages and easy maintenance and updates to the overall design of a website.
                            To see some examples of how to use CSS, go to the next tab.

                        <h3>
                            Much like starting your first HTML file, you can right click on the left hand side menu to create a new file.
                            This file should not contain spaces and must end with .css to declare that it is a CSS file.
                            Once done, return to the HTML document that you want to link the CSS document to and go inside the head element of the file.
                            Once there, type: <br/> <code>&lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "The CSS file's name"&gt;</code> <br/> Once you are done with that, you should now be able to code your CSS file such so that it should influence the visuals of the HTML page.

                    <div class = "fade">
                        <h2 class = "HeaderPoint">CSS Declarations</h2>
                        <h3>CSS Declarations are simple lines of code that help us define exact attributes (or in this case styles) that we want specific elements to take on. To use CSS Declarations, you have to follow the syntax shown below:</h3>
                        <div style = "background-color: rgba(45, 43, 43, 0.8); color: aliceblue; margin-left: 10px;">
                            <code>.className{<br/>Insert CSS Declarations here <br />}</code>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class = "inactive">
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle"> Color:</h2>
                            <h3>This is a very simple declaration to understand, as this declaration simply changes the color of text within the element to a color of your choice. When choosing a color, you have to use the RGB system to create your desired color. To use this declaration use the syntax shown below<br /> 
                                <code>color: rgb(0,0,0);</code> <br/>
                            </h3>
                            <h3 style = "margin-top: 10px">
                                (Note: when using rgb Visual Studio Code already gives you a large variety of diffeent colors to work with, so you often don't fully need to manually type in the rgb values of the color you want) 
                            </h3>
                            
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Background color:</h2><h3>This is another simple declaration to understand, as it simply changes the background color of the element. Much like the color declaration, you also have to utilise the rgb system to select your colors.
                                When you use this declaration, use the syntax:<br /> <code>background-color: rgb(0,0,0);</code>
                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Font Size:</h2><h3>This declaration is in charge of what the size of the text will be. To use this, you have to define the font size as a specific size in terms of pixels (we will discuss alternate unit of measurements other than pixels later).
                                When you use this delcaration, use the syntax:<br /> <code>font-size: 16px;</code>

                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Font Family:<h2><h3> This delcaration is used to change the font of the selected element. To use it, simply just state what font you would like to use (eg: Arial, Times New Roman, etc). However, there are many fonts that are unsupported in CSS, so if you want to import your own fonts that you would like to use, please check out <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g15mF_XAOB8&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwP0AxnbBiDBCi53LK9uCMZ&index=13&t=0s">this tutorial</a>.
                                When you use this declaration, use the syntax:<br /> <code>font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;</code>

                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Border:</h2><h3>This declaration is used to add borders to your selected elements. When using this declaration, you have to first declare the width of the border (for now use pixels), then declare the style of the border (which can be: solid, dotted, double, dashed, inset, outset, ridge, groove, and hidden), and finally declare a color for the border (once again, you have to use the RGB system to define the color).
                                An example of how the syntax would look like would be:<br /> <code>border: 5px, solid, rgb(0,0,0);</code>

                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Border radius:</h2><h3> This is a very simple declaration and links back to the previous declaration on borders. The border radius declaration simply declares how round the edges of the border will become. To use this, you have to input how round you want to make the borders using pixels (or other supported units of measurement in Visual Studio Code). <br/> Note: if you want to make a completley circular border, you can set the border radius to the height of the element.
                                When you use this delcaration, use the syntax:<br /> <code>border-radius: 2px;</code>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle"> Padding</h2>
                            <h3> In HTML, padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. It allows you to create space inside an element, pushing the content away from the edges.

                            <h3>In HTML, a border refers to the boundary or outline that surrounds an element. It is a visual property that helps differentiate and define the edges of an element on a web page.

                                Borders can be applied to various HTML elements such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, and more. They can be customized in terms of color, style, and width.
