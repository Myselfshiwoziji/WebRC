                            <h3> Animations in HTML and CSS are techniques used to bring elements on a web page to life, creating movement and visual effects. They allow developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to their websites, enhancing the user experience. In this course, we will teach you to use <code>@keyframe</code>, and <code>from ... to ...</code> to display simple animations.
                            </h3>
                        </div>


                        <div class = "fade">
                            <h2 class = "HeaderPoint">Making animations</h2>
                            <div class = "inactive">
                                <h2 class = "contentTitle">Method 1: Keyframe percentages</h2>
                                <h3> Keyframes are static frames where something happens. These will serve as your pivot points to manipulate your animation around, with the animations essentially being the smooth connections between the keyframes.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> To make a keyframe, you insert a <code>@keyframe</code> in CSS, then selecting your name, and assign what you want to keyframe to do. Use percentages to indicate what you want the keyframe to do at a specific completion precentage (starting at 0% and ending at 100%) For example:
                                    <code>
                                        <br>@keyframes example {
                                            <br>&emsp;0% {background-color:rgb(0,0,0);}
                                            <br>&emsp;34% {background-color:rgb(255,0,0);
                                            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;font-size:30px;}
                                            <br>&emsp;67% {background-color:rgb(0,255,0);}
                                            <br>&emsp;100% {background-color:rgb(0,0,255);}
                                        <br>}

                                        <br>#animation {
                                            <br>&emsp;animation: example 2s linear infinite
                                        <br>}
                                    </code>

                                    <br><br>To reference the animation, just insert the id into the anchor/ paragraph/ otherwise that you want the animation to be played on.
                                    <br> for example, using the keyframes above:
                                    <br><code>&lt;a id = 'animation'&gt;hi!&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                                    <br> if you used the example above, you should get these results:
                                </h3>

                                <h2 class = "contentTitle">id's with animations</h2>
                                <h3>
                                    Has you have seen above, you can see that we have used an ID to link the animation to the text, which is one of the main features of IDs, that they can bring properties of the ID to all of the elements that have the ID. 

                                </h3>

                                <h2 class = "contentTitle">Method 2: From ... To ...</h2>
                                <h3>
                                    From the text itself, it should be self explanatory on how this method works. Once you play the animation, it will go from 'from' all the way to 'end'. See the example below:
                                    <code>
                                        <br>@keyframes slidein {
                                            <br>&emsp;from {
                                              <br>&emsp;&emsp;margin-left: 100%;
                                              <br>&emsp;&emsp;width: 300%; 
                                            <br>&emsp;}
                                          
                                            <br>&emsp;to {
                                              <br>&emsp;&emsp;margin-left: 0%;
                                              <br>&emsp;&emsp;width: 100%;
                                            <br>&emsp;}
                                          <br>}
                                    </code> 
                                    <br>Then, simply insert your animation to your desired element in the way that you did with keyframes. Note that you would assign properties of the animation like speed, repeats, length, etc. in the ID and not the animation itself. 
                                    Both methods work well, so just decide on which that you want to use. FOr the purpsoes of this lesson, most of the practices will be using method 1, but note that it is entirely valid to use method 2 as well.

                                <h2 class = "HeaderPoint">Duration</h2>
                                <h3>assigning the <code>animation-duration</code> attribute to an animation can control its duration. (make sure to specify whether its in miliseconds or seconds)</h3>

                                <h2 class = "HeaderPoint">Timing</h2>
                                <h3>This defines how fast an animation is played during the time which it is played. The prompts can include <code>ease</code>, which is a prompt where it goes from slow to fast exponentially (ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out), and <code>linear</code> where it goes from slow to fast in a linear manner.</code> </h3>
                                <br> Heres an example of how different timings change, given the same animation as above (take note that all of these animations are 2s long):

                                <h3>Iterations is the number of times an animation is played. using <code>animation-iteration-count</code>, you can control the amount of times its played, from <code>1</code> to <code>infinite</code> for continuous looping. Or, you can just do it in the id with the syntax <code>animation: [name] [duration of animation] [Timing] [iterations]</code>
                                    For example, with the example above, you can see that the name is example, the animation is 2s long, it goes linearly to completion, and it loops infinitely.</h3>

                                <h3> In fact, all other HTML attributes works in animations as well! The only difference is that the object will return to the original state after the animation is played. Such, other commands such as displays, margins, scale, position, etc. works just as the same as if you were assigning a class.</h3>
