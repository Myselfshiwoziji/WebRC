### Welcome to the WebRC Repository!

This website was designed as a teaching supplement to a school coding club, showing what can be done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you're currently in the club, follow along with us on the website! If not, there's still content, activities, and past recordings accessible anytime.
