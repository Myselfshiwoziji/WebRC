### Welcome to the Web@RC Repository!

This website was designed as a teaching supplement to a school coding club, showing what can be done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you're currently in the club, [follow along with us on the website!](https://myselfshiwoziji.github.io/WebRC) If not, there's still content, activities, and past recordings accessible anytime.
