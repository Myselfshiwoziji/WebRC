Welcome to the Web Dev Course repository!
This website was designed as a teaching supplement to a school club on the basics of web development,
showing what can be done with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you're currently in the club, follow along with us on the website!
If not, still feel free to follow along with the website's recorded lectures and activities.
