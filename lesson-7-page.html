                            JavaScript, also abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, object-oriented scripting language used to program functionality to an HTML page.
                            The language is quintessential for web developers to process user inputs and manipulate HTML and CSS content, taking a website beyond static slideshow.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            Javascript can interact with HTML in many ways, but most often you will link functions to buttons and other user actions,
                            manipulating elements by finding their assigned IDs and making respective modifications.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            JavaScript is often paired with 3rd-party libraries such as JQuery. For simplicity, this course will only cover with fundamental JS.

                            Create a new file ending in <code>.js</code> to declare it for JavaScript.
                            Once created, return to your HTML document and type:
                        </h3>

                            Unlike with CSS files, which are placed in the header, it is best practice to link your JavaScript file just before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> closing tab.
                            This is so all HTML elements are loaded before the script runs.

                                To modify any element in your HTML file, you'll first need to tell the JavaScript file where to look.
                                The most straightforward way to do this is to first give your HTML element an id:
                            </h3>
                            <h3>

                            <h3>
                                Then declare your JavaScript variable with:

                                Use <code>.src</code> to read and modify what external recources (i.e. images, audio and videos) an element uses:

                                <code>.style</code> alone returns an object (list) containing every style attribute.
                                Adding <code>.exampleStyleAttribute</code> specifies a single attribute (such as color, font-size, etc.)
                                which is simpler to read and change.

                            In JavaScript (JS), events are actions or occurrences that happen in the user interface or the browser. These events can be triggered by various actions, such as a user clicking a button, pressing a key, or the browser finishing loading a web page.

                        <h3>
                            An event listener is required if you want your program to recognise that you called an event to execute a function. For every function that you put, you will have to add an event listener to an event in JS (for example, the clicking of a button). In short, Event listeners "listen" for specific events and execute a function when the event occurs.

                                The onclick listener in JavaScript is an event handler that is used to execute a particular piece of code when an element, such as a button or a link, is clicked by the user. It is commonly used to create interactivity and trigger actions in response to user input.

                                Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning that they are accessible within the function where they are declared, as well as any nested functions within that function. However, variables declared with var are not block-scoped, which means they can also be accessed outside of the block where they are declared.
                                It's worth noting that the var keyword has some characteristics that can lead to unexpected behavior, such as variable hoisting and the lack of block scope.

                            <h3>Variables declared with let are similar to variables declared with var in terms of their ability to store values. However, the key difference is that variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are declared.

                                Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that you cannot access a let variable before it has been declared in your code.

                                <br>
                                Thus, using let allows for better control over variable scope and can help prevent unintended issues that can occur with var. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use this instead of var when declaring variables, especially in modern JavaScript development.

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Const:</h2>
                            <h3>
                                When a variable is declared with const, its value cannot be changed once it is assigned. This makes const variables suitable for storing values that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program.
                                Like variables declared with let, const variables are also block-scoped. They are only accessible within the block where they are declared and they are not hoisted to the top of their scope.
                                However, it's important to note that while the value of a const variable cannot be reassigned, it does not mean that the value itself is immutable. If a const variable holds an object or an array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned to a different object or array.
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                Overall, using const helps convey the intent that a variable should remain constant, which can enhance code readability and prevent accidental reassignments. Thus, it is recommended to use const instead of var or let when declaring a variable that do not need to be reassigned.

                               If your variable isn't going to be modified during the duration of your code, use <code>const</code> to prevent accidentally accessing or reasigning values.
                               If the variable will be changed, try to use <code>let</code> to keep the scope of your variable to your block.
                               This will prevent accidentally accessing an old variable outside the relevant area if you have variables with similar names.
                               Try to only declare variables with <code>var</code> if necessary.
