                        <h3>
                            Cookies are one of the most important concepts to understand and utilise when making a website. Cookies are essetially small files of datat that can be stored on the client side
                            without the need to be saved on the server side of the website. Essentially, it allows for data to be stored in a way such so that even without the use of WiFi it still exists. This can be very useful 
                            when designing web applications as it allows for offline support.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            To first start using cookies, we can start by downloading a library which allows us to easily access, modify, create, and delete cookies from the browser. The library we are going to use is the 
                            cookie parser library. To download this library, go to the terminal inside the Visual Studio Code app and type in <code>npm install cookie-parser</code>.
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                            After that, you can then call upon the cookie parser library inside any file in the project by requiring it at the top of the file by typing out:<br>
                            <code>var cookies = require('cookie-parser')</code>
                        </h3>
                    </div>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">How to use the cookie parser library</h2>
                            <h3>
                                The cookie parser library offers a variety of different functions that you can use in order to do a variety of different functions with cookies. Since we defined the cookie parser as cookies in the example above, we will be referring 
                                to the library as cookies in the examples below to demonstrate how to use the library.
                            </h3>
 
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Creating a cookie</h2>
                            <h3>
                                To create a cookie using this library, you can simply do this by using the function res.cookies(). Inside the brackets, you then have to define the name of the cookie as the first string, and then the value of the cookie afterwards. An 
                                example of this would be:<br>
                                <code>res.cookies("foo", "bar")</code>
                            </h3>

                            <h3>
                                This code above basically creates a cookie in the browser that is named foo, and has the string value of bar. To check the cookies in your web application, you can go to the console of the browser, then click on the two arrows,
                                and then click on application. This should show a variety of different aspects of the website, but the one we only need to focus on is the cookies section. So click that, and then check your cookies.
                            </h3>

                            <h3>
                                Alternativly, you can also type in <code>console.log(req.cookies)</code> to console log the cookies in the web application.
                            </h3>
                            
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Deleting a cookie</h2>
                            <h3>
                               Deleting a cookie is quite easy to do in cookie parser, as all you need to do is call upon the function res.clearCookie(). Inside the brackets, you then just type in the name of the cookie that you want to delete in string format. An example of this would be:<br>
                               <code>res.clearCookie('foo')</code>
                            </h3>

                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Additional settings for cookies</h2>
                            <h3>
                                The cookie parser library also allows for specific settings for the cookies which you create and push to the browser. To do this, add an additional curly bracket after the value of the cookie is defined inside the res.cookies() function.
                                This should give you code that looks like this:
                                <br><code>res.cookies("foo", "bar", {<br>})</code>
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                Inside this curly brackets, you can then define a couple of settings for the cookie. The first one is the maximum age of the cookie. This basically defines how long the cookie is allowed to exist for befire being deleted. This value is 
                                measured in milliseconds (which is 1/1000th of a second). To define this, you can simply type inside the curly brackets maxAge: number, where number is basically the time you allow the cookie to exist.
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                The other option is expires, which sets a date to which the cookie will expire. You can do this by typing in expires: new Date("INSERT_DATE_HERE").
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                The third option is httpOnly, which basically means that the cookie will only appear or exist if the website is a http website. This allows for a layer of protection for the cookie from any possible XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks that might 
                                try to steal your cookie information. To do this, you can simply go to the curly brackets and type in httpsOnly: true. As a side note if you want to have multiple of these properties together you simply just seperate each one by using a comma.
                            </h3>

                            <h3>
                                The final option is secure, which controls whether or not the cookie is set based on whether or not the website is an https website or not. This allows for further security protocals to be in place for the event that the data of a cookie might be stolen, as 
                                https websites are highly secure due to their usage of encryption along with other special features. To do this, you can simply just type in the curly brackets secure: true.

                            <h3>
                                To first setup, download the passport-google-oauth2 library by typing out the following code into the console of the VSC app:<br>
                                <code>npm install passport-google-oauth2</code>

                            <h3>
                                To set up the passport strategy for Google Authentication, you have to first make a new JavaScript file with the passport library, passport-google-oauth2 library, and the userInfo model made eariler in Lesson 11. For the purposes of this 
                                explanation, we will be referring to the passport library as passport, the passport-google-oauth2 library as GoogleStrategy, and the userInfo model as userInfo. Much like the local strategy done in lesson 11, for this authentication system you will need to 
                                require the passport-google-oauth2 as a .Strategy. 
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                Doing all this will give you code that should look like this:<br>
                                <div class = "codeDiv">
                                    <code>
                                        const Googlepassport = require('passport')<br>
                                        var GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth2').Strategy;<br>
                                        const userInfo = require('..//models/userCreation');
                                    </code>
                                </div>
                            </h3>

                            <h3>
                                Now that the basic imports are done we can start working on the Google Strategy itself. So go into the code and use the passport.use() function on a new GoogleStrategy. Inside the passport.use() function,
                                we then type new GoogleStrategy({}), and then type in four main parameters inside the curly brackets seperated with a comma. These four main parameters are: clientID, clientSecret, callbackURL, and passReqToCallback.
                                Doing this should give you code that looks like this:

                                Now, in order to access the Google Oauth 2.0 authentication functions we need to first use our own individual clientID's provided by Google. To do this, you can use a private Gmail account 
                                and go to the Google Cloud webpage. You should then use your private account and create a new project. Inside this new Google Cloud project you should then access the API's and Services tab and then go to the library 
                                tab inside the API and Services tab. Once in, you should then download the Google+ API.

                                Now that thats done you can then go to the credentials tab to create a new credential for your Oauth 2.0 Client ID's. Inside this tab you should then select the application type to be a web application. For the Authorised Javascript Location, this 
                                is where you typically put your domain, but since we are locally running the website, you can just type "https://localhost:port_number" (the port_number being the port number you chose when you first started making your backend system). Now, for the Authorised 
                                Redirect URIs, you can just type in "https://localhost:port_number/auth/google/redirect". Please paste this pathway also in your callbackURL part of your new GoogleStrategy.

                            <h3>
                                Doing all of this will then finally generate a clientID for you to use and to be pasted as the value of the clientID portion of the new GoogleStrategy.<br>
                                In case you need a visual tutorial for how to do this, <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NkKysI0PLrFSoeZTl2gtNKY6HSJvke79/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here is a video demonstration for all of this</a>

                                Inside this new async function, you should do an await command for finding a user with the email with the value of profile.emails[0].value.<br>

                                Now that you have that, you can then put a .then() function after the awaited command with the parameters of user and error. Inside the .then() function, put a if statement with the parameter of user,
                                and inside that if statement return done with the values of null and user. Then put a else if statement afterwards with the conditions of !user, and in this scenario creating a new user using the values of 
                                profile.displayName and profile.emails[0].value as the new username and email address for this new user. Then, simply save this new user to the database and return done with the values of null and the new user created.

                                with a comma afterwards with the middleware of passport.authenticate('google', {scope: ['profile', 'email']}).

                                req.user as the parameter for the if statement. Inside the if statement, type in res.redirect('/INSERT_WANTED_PATH_HERE'), and in the else statement, redirect them back to the login page.

                                This code above basically does three main things, the first thing it does is that it sets the default file for what the webpage will look like as an ejs file. It then 
                                sets the "views" file we set up earlier as where the ejs files are stored. Finally, the urlencoded function makes it so that middleware functions are not directly put into 
                                the url (you will learn more about this later).

                            <h3>
                                Now that we have the general setup for using Express JS we can then go back to our .ejs file and customise it to look like how we want it to look like when it is 
                                displayed in the webpage. This is done by using simple HTML, much like before.

                            <h3>
                                After that, we can then go back to our main Javascript backend file and then type in the following code to set up our homepage:<br>
                                <div class = "codeDiv">  
                                    <code>
                                        app.get("/", (req, res)=>{<br>
                                        &nbsp app.render('INSERT_EJS_FILE_NAME')<br>
                                        })
                                    </code>

                                </div>

                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                What this code above does is that it basically makes it so when the user accesses the / page (or the default url for the website) it will render the ejs file of our choice.
                                Since we already set the server to interpret the rendered files as ejs files we don't need to add the .ejs after the end of our file name in the render function.
                            </h3>
                            <h2 class = "contentTitle">Going further with Express JS</h2>
                            <h3>
                                Express JS has some interesting features which can be used in order to further control what is displayed to a user of the webpage better than what base HTML could offer. One
                                example of this would be passing specific variables to be loaded into a page. You can do this by first adding this element into anywhere into ejs file:<br>
                                &lt;%= INSERT_VARIABLE_NAME %&gt;
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                This basically makes it so that there is now a variable that can be manipulated and placed anywhere in the ejs file. Typically you would use this to customise and load user specific info
                                (eg loading the user's username in the homepage of the website after logging in). In order to set the value of this string variable, you can add the following to your app.render line:<br>
                            </h3>
                            <h3>

                                    <code>app.get("/", (req,res)=>{<br>
                                            &nbsp res.render ("INSERT_EJS_FILE_NAME",{<br>
                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INSERT_VARIABLE_NAME = VARIABLE_VALUE<br>
                                            &nbsp;&nbsp;})<br>
                                        })
                                    </code>

                                If you want to, you can have multiple of these variables in your webpage, all you need to do is add a comma after the first defined variable value in the render function, and then type in the next
                                variable you want to define and use in the webpage you are loading.

                            <h3>
                                Unlike base HTML, loading in CSS and JavaScript files into your .ejs file is a bit different, and requires a different process and setup to load them in. In order to add CSS and JavaScript files to 
                                your webpage, first make a new folder and name it "public", and then make two sub folders inside of them named "CSS" and "JavaScript". Much like the file names suggest, place all the CSS and Javascript
                                files in these folders respectivley.
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                After that, put the following line of code inside your main JavaScript file:
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                <code>
                                    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
                                </code>
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                What this line above does is that it sets the main directory file for finding CSS, JavaScript, and other files that are going to be loaded into the .ejs files.
                            </h3>
                            <h3>
                                After this, go back to your ejs files in your view folder, and then add a CSS file from the CSS folder you created using the standardised syntax you are used to. However, an important thing to now note is that
                                you firstly don't have to reference the folder that the CSS folder is inside of, as it already knows which folder to look into. You also need to define MIME types everytime you load something in.
                                An example of this would be:
                            </h3>

                                    &lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "/css/example.css" type = "text/css"&gt;
                                </code>

                            <h3>
                                You need to follow this sort of formatting for any file that you have to import into your HTML file. You also need to change the type to the appropriate type (for example JavaScript would not
                                have the type of "text/css"). To see all the possible MIME types for HTML, you can refer to <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types" target="_blank">this website</a>.
